# Binary Heap

## What is a Binary Heap

- It's a data structure 
- It's a non-linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes
- Binary Trees have at most 2 child nodes

- In a **MaxBinaryHeap**, parent nodes are always larger than the child nodes.
- In a **MinBinaryHeap**, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

- Insertion - **Big O(log n)**
- Removal - **Big O(log n)**
- Search - **Big O(n)**
