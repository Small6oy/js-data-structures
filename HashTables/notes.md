# Hash Table

## What is a Hash Table

- It's a data structure 
- Used to store key-value pairs
- They are like arrays, but keys are not ordered.

- They are fast, for all operations, finding values, adding new values and removing values

- Insertion - **Big O(log n)**
- Removal - **Big O(log n)**
- Search - **Big O(n)**

Nearly every languages has an implementation of hash maps

- In **Pytho**, **Dictionaries**
- In **Js**, **Objects** and **Maps**
- In **Java**, **Go** & **Scala** have **Maps**
- In **Ruby**, **Hashes**
